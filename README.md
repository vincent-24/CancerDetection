## Introduction
1. Machine learning is not uncommon to find in the medical field since trained models help identify hidden patterns.
1. The objective of this project is to compare a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) architecture, and a CNN using Transfer Learning to classify kidney tumors.

## Background
1. There is limited data due to privacy concerns which makes it important to build efficient and accurate models based on the data we have.
1. Traditional machine learning rely on handcrafted features and using images would be more effective.
1. Transfer learning can help identify medical conditions by using a source that is similar to the target domain, and it reduces the need to train new models for different tasks (i.e. Brain Tumor Detection model & Kidney Tumor Detection model).

## Objective
1. Compare the performance of CNNs, FCNNs, and a Transfer Learning CNN.
1. CNNS and FCNNS are common approaches to image classification. However they require retraining to make accurate classifications on differring source and target domains.
